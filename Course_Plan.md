Course Plan
===========

Intent
------
This is a 6-week course in the Foundations of Machine Learning. The purpose of this course is to give a thorough introduction to the theory and practice of Machine Learning. We will use Spark MLlib for demonstrations and practice throughout the course.

Course Content
---------------------------------
1. Introduction, Probability Theory, Linear Algebra
2. Linear and Logistic Regression
3. Regularization, Dimensionality Reduction
4. Stochastic Gradient Descent
5. Support Vector Machines
6. Bayesian Approaches

Reference Material
---------
Most of the content of this course will be based on the book **Deep Learning** by *Goodfellow*, *Bengio*, and *Courville* published by MIT Press. The intent is to cover roughly Chapters 1-5, although some of the content won't be covered. Conversely, some of the content in the course won't be covered by the text. Regardless, I would highly recommend the book. You can purchase it from Amazon [here](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Adaptive-Computation-Machine/dp/0262035618/).

Spark MLlib will be our development framework. Spark's official guide to MLlib is published [here](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-guide.html). We may use Spark Structured Streaming by the end of the course. An API reference can be found [here](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/structured-streaming-programming-guide.html).

Also feel free to clone my [*spark-ml* Github repository](https://github.com/phuriku/spark-ml), run the examples, and play around with the material. This may be the best route for those not yet unacquainted with *Scala* or *sbt*.
